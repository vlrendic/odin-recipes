    <p>These strawberries and cream cupcakes are light as air, with a scrumptious 
        strawberry and cream filling and topping.</p>

    <p>If you are short on time, you could absolutely skip the cutting-and-filling 
        part of this recipeâ€”and simply frost the tops of the cupcakes with 
        the whipped cream and strawberries instead.</p>

        <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup plus 2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>3 large egg whites, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon almond extract</li>
        <li>2/3 cup full-fat sour cream, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1/3 cup 2% milk, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2 ounces full-fat cream cheese, chilled</li>
        <li>1/4 cup powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
    </ul>
    

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Strawberries: Place strawberries and sugar in a small pot over 
            medium-low heat. <br>Bring mixture to a simmer, stirring often, and 
            cook for 5 minutes.

        </li>
        <li>Stir cornstarch and water together in a small bowl or measuring cup. 
            <br>Stir cornstarch mixture into the strawberry mixture, and 
            <br>cook until thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove pot from heat, and 
            <br>stir in lemon zest and lemon juice. Pour mixture into a heat safe bowl, 
            <br>and place uncovered into the fridge to chill. 
            <br>(Once mixture is chilled and no longer condensing, you can then 
            cover the bowl.)</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 cupcake pans with liners.</li>
        <li>Return chicken to the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, 
            until sauce is thickened slightly and chicken is 
            coated in the sauce and cooked through.  
            Serve over rice and sprinkled with reserved green onions.</li>
