    <p>These strawberries and cream cupcakes are light as air, with a scrumptious 
        strawberry and cream filling and topping.</p>

    <p>If you are short on time, you could absolutely skip the cutting-and-filling 
        part of this recipe—and simply frost the tops of the cupcakes with 
        the whipped cream and strawberries instead.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 cups chopped strawberries</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest, or to taste</li>

        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup plus 2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>3 large egg whites, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon almond extract</li>
        <li>2/3 cup full-fat sour cream, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1/3 cup 2% milk, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2 ounces full-fat cream cheese, chilled</li>
        <li>1/4 cup powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
    </ul>
    

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Strawberries: Place strawberries and sugar in a small pot over 
            medium-low heat. <br>Bring mixture to a simmer, stirring often, and 
            cook for 5 minutes.

        </li>
        <li>Stir cornstarch and water together in a small bowl or measuring cup. 
            <br>Stir cornstarch mixture into the strawberry mixture, and 
            <br>cook until thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove pot from heat, and 
            <br>stir in lemon zest and lemon juice. Pour mixture into a heat safe bowl, 
            <br>and place uncovered into the fridge to chill. 
            <br>(Once mixture is chilled and no longer condensing, you can then 
            cover the bowl.)</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 cupcake pans with liners.</li>
        <li>Cupcakes: Sift together cake flour, baking powder, salt, 
            baking soda, and nutmeg.
        </li>
        <li>
            Beat butter, oil, and 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. 
            <br>Add in egg whites, vanilla, and almond extract, and beat mixture on medium-high speed for another 3 minutes. 
            <br>Add in half of flour mixture and mix until just combined. Add in sour cream and milk; mix until just combined. 
            <br>Add in remaining flour mixture; mix until just combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour batter into prepared cupcake pans, filling each liner no more than 2/3 full. 
            <br>Bake one pan at a time, until tops of cupcakes spring back when lightly touched, 22 to 26 minutes. 
            <br>Allow cupcakes to cool in the pan for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely, about 30 minutes Chill cupcakes in the refrigerator for about 1 hour. 
            <br>This will make them easier to cut and fill.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cream cheese whipped cream: Beat chilled cream cheese, powdered sugar, vanilla, and salt together until smooth. 
            <br>Add in 1/2 cup cold heavy cream, and mix on low until mixture is smooth. 
            <br>Add in remaining heavy cream; beat on medium-high until mixture holds stiff peaks. 
            <br>If desired, place mixture into a piping bag fitted with an open star tip (such as a Wilton® 1M). 
            <br>Place piping bag in refrigerator until ready to use.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove cupcakes from refrigerator. Remove the liners and cut tops off cupcakes. Pipe a layer of whipped cream on bottom half of cupcakes; top with about 1 to 2 teaspoons strawberry mixture. 
            <br>Place tops of cupcakes back on, and lightly press down to adhere. Pipe more whipped cream on top of cupcakes and top with another 1 to 2 teaspoons strawberry mixture. 
            <br>Chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before serving.
        </li>
    </ol>
